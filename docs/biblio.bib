  abstract =     "In this paper, we present a number of Application Program
                 Interfaces (APIs) for coding linear algebra algorithms.  On the
                 surface, these APIs for the MATLAB M-script and C programming
                 languages appear to be simple, almost trivial, extensions of those
                 languages.  Yet with them, the task of programming and maintaining
                 families of algorithms for a broad spectrum of linear algebra
                 operations is greatly simplified.  In combination with our Formal
                 Linear Algebra Methods Environment (FLAME) approach to deriving such
                 families of algorithms, dozens of algorithms for a single linear
                 algebra operation can be derived, verified to be correct, implemented,
                 and tested, often in a matter of minutes per algorithm.  Since the
                 algorithms are expressed in code much like they are explained in a
                 classroom setting, these APIs become not just a tool for implementing
                 libraries, but also a valuable tool for teaching the algorithms that
                 are incorporated in the libraries.  In combination with an extension
                 of the Parallel Linear Algebra Package (PLAPACK) API, the approach
                 presents a migratory path from algorithm to MATLAB implementation to
                 high-performance sequential implementation to parallel implementation.
                 Finally, the APIs are being used to create a repository of algorithms
                 and implementations for linear algebra operations, the FLAME Interface
                 REpository (FIRE), which already features hundreds of algorithms for
                 dozens of commonly encountered linear algebra operations.",

                 presented, the correctness of the algorithms carries through to the
                 correctness of the implementations.  Analytically motivated heuristics
                 are used to subsequently choose members from the family that can be
                 expected to yield high performance.  Finally, we report performance on
                 the Intel (R) Pentium (R) III processor that is competitive with that
                 of recursive algorithms reported previously in the literature for this

  abstract =     "This paper discusses the high-performance parallel implementation of the 
                 computation and updating of QR factorizations of dense matrices, including 
                 problems large enough to require out-of-core computation, where the matrix 
                 is stored on disk. The algorithms presented here are scalable both in 
                 problem size and as the number of processors increases. Implementation 
                 using the Parallel Linear Algebra Package (PLAPACK) and the Parallel 
                 Out-of-Core Linear Algebra Package (POOCLAPACK) is discussed. The methods 
                 are shown to attain excellent performance, in some cases attaining roughly 
                 80 percent of the  realizable peak of the architectures on which the 
                 experiments were performed.",

                 bidiagonalization requires a significant portion of the execution time for computing matrix singular

                 bidiagonalization of a general $m \times n$ matrix, so that two (\_GEMV) vector-matrix multiplications 
                 can be done with one pass of the unreduced trailing part of the matrix through cache. Two new BLAS
                 operations approximately cut in half the transfer of data from main memory to cache, reducing
                 execution times by up to 25 per cent. We give detailed algorithm descriptions and compare timings
                 with the current LAPACK bidiagonalization algorithm.",

@conference{PPoPP15:batched,
	Abstract = {As hardware evolves, an increasingly effective approach to develop energy efficient, high-performance solvers, is to design them to work on many small and independent problems. Indeed, many applications already need this functionality, especially for GPUs, which are known to be currently about four to five times more energy efficient than multicore CPUs for every floating-point operation. In this paper, we describe the development of the main one-sided factorizations: LU, QR, and Cholesky; that are needed for a set of small dense matrices to work in parallel. We refer to such algorithms as batched factorizations. Our approach is based on representing the algorithms as a sequence of batched BLAS routines for GPU-contained execution. Note that this is similar in functionality to the LAPACK and the hybrid MAGMA algorithms for large-matrix factorizations. But it is different from a straightforward approach, whereby each of GPU{\textquoteright}s symmetric multiprocessors factorizes a single problem at a time.We illustrate how our performance analysis together with the profiling and tracing tools guided the development of batched factorizations to achieve up to 2-fold speedup and 3-fold better energy efficiency compared to our highly optimized batched CPU implementations based on the MKL library on a two-sockets, Intel Sandy Bridge server. Compared to a batched LU factorization featured in the NVIDIA{\textquoteright}s CUBLAS library for GPUs, we achieves up to 2.5-fold speedup on the K40 GPU.},
