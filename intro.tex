In this exercise, we are going to optimize \Gemm{} (General Matrix-Matrix
Multiplication) on modern computer architectures.
Specifically, we consider the simple case:
$$C:=C+A*B$$
where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are $n\times n$ matrices. \Gemm{} can be performed using
$2n^3$ floating point operations, as illustrated in the following pseudocode:
